          The RMI Report 2022 seeks evidence of companiesâ€™ policies and practices on economic, environmental, social and governance (EESG) issues, but does not seek to measure the actual outcomes achieved on EESG issues. Results are based only on evidence sourced from the public domain or provided by companies as open data. Whilst this information is believed to be reliable, no guarantee can be given that it is accurate or complete, nor does it preclude the possibility that policies and practices may exist, but which the RMI Report 2022 has not been able to consider for purposes of assessment. In this respect, the results of the low-scoring companies do not necessarily reflect a lack of relevant policies and practices; as they may be due to a lack of public reporting by the companies, limitations in accessing information, and/or any difficulties in accessing the RMI company portal.
          </p>

          <p className="disclaimer-text">
          It should be noted that, prior to publication, all companies in the RMI were invited to check the factual accuracy of the contextual data and evidence upon which the RMI is based and to review company information in the RMI document library.
